# MulticastDelegate
An elegant multicast delegate written in swift with Unit tests

Getting Started 
============

1. Copy MulticastDelegate.swift to your project
2. add to your class: `let multicastDelegate = MulticastDelegate<MyProtocol>()`
3. Other classes must add as a delegate: `service.delegate += self`
4. When you need to notify your delegates: `multicastDelegate.invokeDelegates { delegate in delegate?.done() }` alternatively `multicastDelegate |> { delegate in delegate?.done() }`

If you are using cocoaPods:

	pod 'MulticastDelegateSwift'
Add to your code:

	import MulticastDelegateSwift

Example
===========

    protocol TestDelegate {
	
	    func doThis()
    }

    class DelegateTestClass: TestDelegate {
	
	    func doThis() {
	    	// do nothing
    	}
    	func doThis(value:Int) {
	    	print(value)
	    }
    }

    class ServiceTestClass {
	
    	var delegate = MulticastDelegate<TestDelegate>()
	
	    func imReady() -> Bool {
		    // Call your delegates 
	    	delegate |> { delegate in
			
		    	delegate?.doThis()
			
	    	}

		    return true
    	}
    }



    let service = ServiceTestClass()
	let demoDelegateClass = DelegateTestClass()
		
	service.delegate += demoDelegateClass
		
	service.imReady()
    

Considerations
============
The code is based on NSHashTable with weak objects, so you don't need to worry when a delegate is deallocated
